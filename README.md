Autoplay Feature

●	What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
	While developing this game, multiple challenges arose especially during deployment with Render. There were issues with the configurations and settings on top of the deployment codes. However, the logs on the dashboard and the abundant resources from render’s website made it easier when troubleshooting and successfully deployed after a few versions. Furthermore, keeping the game running correctly and smoothly was a great challenge. Finding and correctly calculating the right cell based on neighboring cells took some time as well.  
●	Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
Given more time, I would first update the appearance and introduce a better front-end interface for the website. This includes a more appealing overall theme and color tone as well as smooth transitions with more interactive elements such as having the user pick their colors and timer setting. The current color tone and design may have not contributed to the look I am going for. Furthermore, I would also try to complete the longer-lasting cell challenge as well. I had some trouble with correctly implementing it without breaking the game. I think that with more time, I can experiment more with the rules and progression of the game to make the game even more interesting.  
●	What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
I assumed the sizes and grid of the game layout and web layouts. Most sizes with values were my assumption in an attempt to maintain certain appearances while not breaking the game. Since progression is relatively fast, I added a little bit of time to the progression as well as implementing a start and stop autoplay button to make the progression pausable for a user to see before continuing. Assumptions were also made for deploying on render. Some decisions and assumptions were made during troubleshooting deployment issues and while fixing problems. 
●	How long did this assignment take to complete? (Obviously, this does not need to be a paragraph)
7 days.
